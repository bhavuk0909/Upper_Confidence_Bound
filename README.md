# Upper_Confidence_Bound
The Upper Confidence Bound algorithm the kind of algorithm that helps us to perform exploitation and exploration together.At the start of the campaign, we don't know what is the best arm or ad. So we cannot distinguish or discriminate any arm or ad. So the UCB algorithm assumes they all have the same observed average value. Then the algorithm creates confidence bound for each arm or ad. So it randomly picks any of the arms or ads. Then two things can happen- the user clicks the ad or the arm gives reward or does not. Let's say the ad did not have a click or the arm was a failure. So the observed average of the ad or arm will go down. And the confidence bound will also go down. If it had a click, the observed average would go up and the confidence bound also goes up. By exploiting the best one we are decreasing the confidence bound. As we are adding more and more samples, the probability of other arms or ad doing well is also going up. This is the fundamental concept of UCB.
